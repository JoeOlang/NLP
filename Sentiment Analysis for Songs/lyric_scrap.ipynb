oh\n[Verse 1]\nYou call me all friendly\nTellin' me how much you miss me\nThat's funny, I guess you've heard my songs\nWell, I'm too busy for your business\nGo find a girl who wants to listen\n'Cause if you think I was born yesterday, you have got me wrong\n\n[Pre-Chorus]\nSo I cut you off\nI don't need your love\n'Cause I already cried enough\nI've been done\nI've been movin' on since we said goodbye\nI cut you off\nI don't need your love\nSo you can try all you want\nYour time is up, I'll tell you why\n\n[Chorus]\nYou say you're sorry, but it's too late now\nSo save it, get gone, shut up\n'Cause if you think I care about you now\nWell, boy, I don't give a fuck\n\n[Verse 2]\nI remember that weekend\nWhen my best friend caught you creepin'\nYou blamed it all on the alcohol\nSo, I made my decision\n'Cause you made your bed, sleep in it\nPlay the victim and switch your position\nI'm through, I'm done\n\n[Pre-Chorus]\nSo I cut you off\nI don't need your love\n'Cause I already cried enough\nI've been done\nI've been movin' on since we said goodbye\nI cut you off\nI don't need your love\nSo you can try all you want\nYour time is up, I'll tell you why\n\n[Chorus]\nYou say you're sorry, but it's too late now\nSo save it, get gone, shut up\n'Cause if you think I care about you now\nWell, boy, I don't give a fuck\n\n[Post-Chorus]\nI see you tryna get to me\nI see you beggin' on your knees\nBoy, I don't give a fuck\nSo stop tryna get to me\nTch, get up off your knees\n'Cause, boy, I don't give a fuck\n\n[Bridge]\nAbout you\nNo, I don't give a damn\nYou keep reminiscin' on when you were my man\nBut I'm over you\nNow you're all in the past\nYou talk all that sweet talk, but I ain't comin' back\n\n[Breakdown]\nCut you off\nI don't need your love\nSo you can try all you want\nYour time is up, I'll tell you why\nI'll tell you why\n\n[Chorus]\nYou say you're sorry, but it's too late now\nSo save it, get gone, shut up\n(Too late now)\n'Cause if you think I care about you now\nWell, boy, I don't give a fuck\n(Boy, I don't give a)\n\n[Post-Chorus]\nI see you tryna get to me\nI see you beggin' on your knees\nBoy, I don't give a fuck\nSo stop tryna get to me (get to me)\nTch, get up off your knees\n'Cause, boy, I don't give a fuck\n[Verse 1]\nIf you wanna run away with me, I know a galaxy\nAnd I can take you for a ride\nI had a premonition that we fell into a rhythm\nWhere the music don't stop for life\nGlitter in the sky, glitter in my eyes\nShining just the way I like\nIf you're feeling like you need a little bit of company\nYou met me at the perfect time\n\n[Pre-Chorus]\nYou want me, I want you, baby\nMy sugarboo, I'm levitating\nThe Milky Way, we're renegading\nYeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah\n\n[Chorus]\nI got you, moonlight, you're my starlight\nI need you all night, come on, dance with me\nI'm levitating\nYou, moonlight, you're my starlight (You're the moonlight)\nI need you all night, come on, dance with me\nI'm levitating\n\n[Verse 2]\nI believe that you're for me, I feel it in our energy\nI see us written in the stars\nWe can go wherever, so let's do it now or never\nBaby, nothing's ever, ever too far\nGlitter in the sky, glitter in our eyes\nShining just the way we are\nI feel like we're forever every time we get together\nBut whatever, let's get lost on Mars\n\n[Pre-Chorus]\nYou want me, I want you, baby\nMy sugarboo, I'm levitating\nThe Milky Way, we're renegading\nYeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah\n\n[Chorus]\nI got you, moonlight, you're my starlight\nI need you all night, come on, dance with me\nI'm levitating\nYou, moonlight, you're my starlight (You're the moonlight)\nI need you all night, come on, dance with me\nI'm levitating\n\n[Post-Chorus]\nYou can fly away with me tonight\nYou can fly away with me tonight\nBaby, let me take you for a ride\nYeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah\nI'm levitating (Woo)\nYou can fly away with me tonight\nYou can fly away with me tonight\nBaby, let me take you for a ride\nYeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah (Woo)\n\n[Bridge]\nMy love is like a rocket, watch it blast off\nAnd I'm feeling so electric, dance my ass off\nAnd even if I wanted to, I can't stop\nYeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah\nMy love is like a rocket, watch it blast off\nAnd I'm feeling so electric, dance my ass off\nAnd even if I wanted to, I can't stop\nYeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah\n\n[Pre-Chorus]\nYou want me, I want you, baby\nMy sugarboo, I'm levitating\nThe Milky Way, we're renegading\n\n[Chorus]\nI got you (Yeah), moonlight, you're my starlight\nI need you all night (All night), come on, dance with me\nI'm levitating (Woo)\n\n[Post-Chorus]\nYou can fly away with me tonight (Tonight)\nYou can fly away with me tonight\nBaby, let me take you for a ride\nYeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah (Take you for a ride)\nI'm levitating (Woo)\nYou can fly away with me tonight (Tonight)\nYou can fly away with me tonight\nBaby, let me take you for a ride\nYeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah (Let me take you for a ride)\n\n[Chorus]\nI got you, moonlight, you're my starlight (You are my starlight)\nI need you all night, come on, dance with me (Come on, dance with me)\nI'm levitating\nYou, moonlight, you're my starlight (You're the moonlight)\nI need you all night, come on, dance with me\nI'm levitating\n[Verse 1]\nI know it's hot\nI know we've got\nSomething that money can't buy\nFighting in fits\nBiting your lip\nLoving 'til late in the night\n\n[Pre-Chorus]\nTell me I'm too crazy\nYou can't tame me, can't tame me\nTell me I have changed\nBut I'm the same me, old same me\nInside\nHey!\n\n[Chorus]\nIf you don't like the way I talk, then why am I on your mind?\nIf you don't like the way I rock, then finish your glass of wine\nWe fight and we argue, you'll still love me blind\nIf we don't fuck this whole thing up\nGuaranteed, I can blow your mind\nMwah!\n\n[Post-Chorus]\nAnd tonight I'm alive, ain't no dollar sign\nGuaranteed, I can blow your mind, mwah\nAnd tonight I'm alive, ain't no dollar sign\nGuaranteed, I can blow your mind, mwah\n(Mwah, mwah, mwah, mwah)\n\n[Verse 2]\nYeah, I'm so bad\nBest that you've had\nI guess you're diggin' the show\nOpen the door\nYou want some more\nWhen you wanna leave, let me know\n\n[Pre-Chorus]\nTell me I'm too crazy\nYou can't tame me, can't tame me\nTell me I have changed\nBut I'm the same me, old same me\nInside\nHey!\n\n[Chorus]\nIf you don't like the way I talk, then why am I on your mind?\nIf you don't like the way I rock, then finish your glass of wine\nWe fight and we argue, you'll

mind, mwah\nAnd tonight I'm alive, ain't no dollar sign\nGuaranteed, I can blow your mind, mwah\n[Verse 1]\nI've always been the one to say the first goodbye\nHad to love and lose a hundred million times\nHad to get it wrong to know just what I like\nNow I'm falling\nYou say my name like I have never heard before\nI'm indecisive, but, this time, I know for sure\nI hope I'm not the only one that feels it all\nAre you falling?\n\n[Pre-Chorus]\nCentre of attention\nYou know you can get whatever you want from me\nWhenever you want it, baby\nIt's you in my reflection\nI'm afraid of all the things it could do to me\nIf I would've known it, baby\n\n[Chorus]\nI would've stayed at home\n'Cause I was doing better alone\nBut when you said, \"Hello\"\nI knew that was the end of it all\nI should've stayed at home\n'Cause now there ain't no letting you go\nAm I falling in love with the one that could break my heart?\nOh no, I was doing better alone\nBut when you said, \"Hello\"\nI knew that was the end of it all\nI should've stayed at home\n'Cause now there ain't no letting you go\nAm I falling in love with the one that could break my heart?\n\n[Verse 2]\nI wonder, when you go, if I stay on your mind\nTwo can play that game, but you win me every time\nEveryone before you was a waste of time\nYeah, you got me\n\n[Pre-Chorus]\nCentre of attention\nYou know you can get whatever you want from me\nWhenever you want it, baby\nIt's you in my reflection\nI'm afraid of all the things it could do to me\nIf I would've known it, baby\n\n[Chorus]\nI would've stayed at home\n'Cause I was doing better alone\nBut when you said, \"Hello\"\nI knew that was the end of it all\nI should've stayed at home (I would've stayed at home 'cause I–)\n'Cause now there ain't no letting you go\nAm I falling in love with the one that could break my heart?\nOh no, I was doing better alone\nBut when you said, \"Hello\"\nI knew that was the end of it all\nI should've stayed at home\n'Cause now there ain't no letting you go\nAm I falling in love with the one that could break my heart?\n\n[Bridge]\nOoh, break my heart\nOoh, break my heart\nOoh\nAm I falling in love with the one that could break my heart?\n\n[Chorus]\nI would've stayed at home\n'Cause I was doing better alone\nBut when you said, \"Hello\"\nI knew that was the end of it all\nI should've stayed at home (I would've stayed at home

## Active learning 
This is a machine learning technique that involves selecting the most informative examples from a large pool of unlabeled data for annotation by a human expert, with the goal of improving model performance while minimizing the amount of labeled data needed. In the context of natural language processing (NLP), active learning can be used to select the most informative examples of text data for annotation, which can then be used to train a fill-mask language model.

## Fill-mask Language Model

In natural language processing (NLP), a fill-mask task is a type of language modeling task where the model is given a sentence with one or more masked words, and the task is to predict the missing words. The input to the model is a sequence of tokens, where some of the tokens are replaced with a special token [MASK] to indicate that the model needs to predict the missing word(s). The output of the model is a probability distribution over the entire vocabulary, and the model predicts the words with the highest probability to fill the masked position(s).

For example, given the sentence "I want to [MASK] a book", a fill-mask model could predict "read" as the missing word. Fill-mask tasks are commonly used in NLP as a benchmark for evaluating the ability of language models to understand and generate natural language.

## Active learning for fill-mask language model

Implementation of an active learning pipeline for training a fill-mask language model in PyTorch:

1. First, we start by importing the necessary libraries and defining some constants:
```python
import torch
import torch.nn as nn
import transformers
from transformers import pipeline


MODEL_NAME = 'bert-base-uncased'
FILL_MASK_PIPELINE = pipeline('fill-mask', model=MODEL_NAME, tokenizer=MODEL_NAME)
```

2. Next, we define a function to select the most informative examples from a pool of unlabeled data. In this case, we will use a simple uncertainty sampling strategy, which selects the examples that the model is least certain about:
```python
def select_examples(pool, n=10):
    scores = []
    for text in pool:
        score = FILL_MASK_PIPELINE(text)[0]['score']
        scores.append(score)
    indices = torch.argsort(torch.tensor(scores))[:n]
    return [pool[i] for i in indices], indices
```

3. We then define a function to annotate the selected examples, using a human expert to fill in the masked token:
```python
Copy code
def annotate_examples(examples):
    labels = []
    for example in examples:
        label = input(f"Fill in the blank: '{example}' ")
        labels.append(label)
    return labels
```

4. With the annotated examples in hand, we can now train a fill-mask language model. Here, we use a BERT-based neural network from the Transformers library:
```python
Copy code
class FillMaskModel(nn.Module):
    def __init__(self, model_name):
        super().__init__()
        self.encoder = transformers.AutoModel.from_pretrained(model_name)
        self.linear = nn.Linear(self.encoder.config.hidden_size, 1)

    def forward(self, inputs):
        outputs = self.encoder(**inputs).last_hidden_state
        logits = self.linear(outputs).squeeze()
        return logits
```
5. We then define a function to train the model using the annotated examples, using active learning to select additional examples to annotate at each iteration:
```python
Copy code
def train_model(initial_pool, model_name, n_iter=5, n_per_iter=10):
    device = torch.device('cuda' if torch.cuda.is_available() else 'cpu')
    model = FillMaskModel(model_name).to(device)
    optimizer = torch.optim.Adam(model.parameters(), lr=1e-4)
    criterion = nn.BCEWithLogitsLoss()

    pool = initial_pool.copy()
    for i in range(n_iter):
        selected, indices = select_examples(pool, n_per_iter)
        labels = annotate_examples(selected)

        pool = [pool[j] for j in range(len(pool)) if j not in indices]
        labeled_data = [(example, label) for example, label in zip(selected, labels)]

        for epoch in range(5):
            for example, label in labeled_data:
                inputs = FILL_MASK_PIPELINE(example)[0]
                inputs = {k: torch.tensor(v).unsqueeze(0).to(device) for k, v in inputs.items()}
                label = torch.tensor(float(label)).to(device)

                logits = model(inputs)
                loss = criterion(logits, label)

                optimizer.zero_grad()
                loss.backward()
                optimizer.step()

        print(f"Iteration {i + 1} complete
```

### Data

To implement active learning for creating a fill-mask language model, you would need a corpus of text data that contains sentences with one or more masked words. You can obtain such data from various sources, such as Wikipedia, news articles, or social media.

You can also use pre-existing datasets that are specifically designed for fill-mask tasks, such as the Masked Language Modeling (MLM) dataset from the Hugging Face Transformers library. This dataset contains thousands of sentences with one or more masked words, and can be used to train and evaluate fill-mask models.

In addition to the text data, you would also need a pre-trained language model such as BERT, RoBERTa, or GPT-2, which can be fine-tuned on the fill-mask data using active learning techniques to improve its performance.


## Hugging Face Save
In Hugging Face, you can save a trained fill-mask language model as a pre-trained model checkpoint that can be later loaded and used for inference or fine-tuning on other tasks. Here's an example code snippet that demonstrates how to save a fill-mask model using Hugging Face:

```python
from transformers import AutoModelForMaskedLM, AutoTokenizer

# Load a pre-trained fill-mask model and tokenizer
model_name = "bert-base-uncased"
model = AutoModelForMaskedLM.from_pretrained(model_name)
tokenizer = AutoTokenizer.from_pretrained(model_name)

# Train and evaluate the model on fill-mask data

# Save the model checkpoint
model.save_pretrained("path/to/checkpoint")
tokenizer.save_pretrained("path/to/checkpoint")
```

In the code above, we first load a pre-trained fill-mask model and tokenizer from the Hugging Face model hub using the AutoModelForMaskedLM and AutoTokenizer classes, respectively. We then train and evaluate the model on fill-mask data using active learning techniques, and finally save the trained model checkpoint and tokenizer to a specified directory using the save_pretrained method.

The saved model checkpoint can be later loaded using the from_pretrained method, as shown in the first line of the code snippet above, and can be fine-tuned or used for inference on other fill-mask tasks.

## Usage
A fill-mask language model trained using active learning techniques can be used for a variety of natural language processing tasks that involve predicting missing or masked words in a sentence. Here are a few examples of tasks that can benefit from a fill-mask language model:

1. Text completion: A fill-mask language model can be used to automatically complete partially written sentences or paragraphs. For example, it can be used in writing assistants to suggest the next word or phrase based on the context of the text.

2. Text correction: A fill-mask language model can be used to correct spelling mistakes or grammatical errors in a sentence. It can predict the most likely replacement for a wrongly spelled word or suggest a replacement word for a grammatically incorrect one.

3. Question-answering: A fill-mask language model can be used to answer questions that require filling in missing information. For example, it can be used to answer questions like "What is the capital city of [MASK]?" by predicting the missing word "France" based on the context.

4. Named entity recognition: A fill-mask language model can be used to predict missing named entities in a sentence, such as people, organizations, or locations. It can predict the most likely entity based on the context of the sentence.

5. etc...

Overall, a fill-mask language model can be used to improve the accuracy and efficiency of various natural language processing tasks that require filling in missing information.
